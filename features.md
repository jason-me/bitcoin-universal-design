# Accessibility Features for Bitcoin Applications

The table below shows how accessibility features designed for specific users create benefits for everyone:

| Accessibility Feature | Who It Helps First | How It Helps Everyone |
|-----------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| **Captions & Visual Alerts** | Deaf or hard-of-hearing users | Quiet or noisy environments, faster information parsing |
| **Voice Control / Keyboard Nav** | Limited mobility | Hands-free convenience, power-user efficiency |
| **High Contrast / Text Size** | Vision impairments | Sunlight use, aging eyes, general readability |
| **Simple UI & Terminology** | Cognitive impairments | Reduces mistakes, speeds up onboarding |
| **Colorblind-friendly design** | Colorblind users | Clearer risk states for everyone |
| **Larger tap targets / gestures** | Motor impairments | Fewer mis-taps on mobile, faster transactions |
| **Offline & Low-bandwidth Support** | Remote or resource-constrained users | Global access, better performance everywhere |

## Implementation Guidelines

### 1. Visual Accessibility

- Use sufficient contrast ratios (at least 4.5:1)
- Don't rely solely on color to convey information
- Support text resizing without breaking layouts
- Test with screen readers for semantic structure

### 2. Cognitive Accessibility

- Use clear, non-technical language
- Provide contextual help and tooltips
- Break complex processes into manageable steps
- Use consistent patterns and visual cues

### 3. Motor Accessibility

- Ensure interactive elements are at least 44×44 pixels
- Provide keyboard navigation options
- Minimize the need for precise gestures
- Include confirmation steps for irreversible actions

### 4. Hearing Accessibility

- Include visual alternatives to audio cues
- Provide captions for video content
- Use multiple notification methods

### 5. Situational Constraints

- Design for offline functionality
- Optimize for low bandwidth
- Consider environmental factors (sunlight, noise, distraction)
