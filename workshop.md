# Workshop Guide (TODO)

The following materials can be used to run a workshop or hackathon focused on accessible Bitcoin application design.

## Workshop Structure 

### 1. Introduction

- Present the core heuristic
- Review why accessibility matters for Bitcoin
- Share examples of universal design benefits

### 2. Persona Development

Have teams develop personas that represent users at the "edges":
- A person who is blind using a screen reader
- Someone who is deaf in a region with intermittent internet access
- An older adult with low vision and limited technical experience
- A person with motor impairments using keyboard navigation

### 3. Design Challenge

Ask teams to redesign a common Bitcoin wallet function for their persona:
- Wallet backup and recovery
- Sending a transaction
- Managing multiple accounts
- Setting security preferences

### 4. Present & Critique

Teams present their designs, focusing on:
- How the design solves for the specific user
- How the solution improves UX for everyone
- Any trade-offs they had to navigate

## Hackathon Challenge

For a longer format hackathon, challenge teams to create accessible Bitcoin tools focusing on one of these areas:

1. **Accessible Onboarding**: Create an onboarding flow that works for users with diverse needs
2. **Universal Recovery**: Design a wallet recovery system that doesn't rely on technical knowledge
3. **Cross-Context Transactions**: Build a transaction flow that works across different environments and abilities
4. **Security Through Clarity**: Create security features that are understandable to all users

## Evaluation Criteria

Score projects based on:
- **Inclusive Design**: How well does it address the needs of users at the margins?
- **Universal Design**: How does solving for edge cases improve the experience for everyone?
- **Technical Feasibility**: Can it be implemented while maintaining Bitcoin's security properties?
- **Innovation**: Does it take a novel approach to solving accessibility challenges?

## Takeaways for Teams

- Test with edge-case users (or personas): new to Bitcoin, older, colorblind, screen reader users
- Treat usability as a key part of enabling bullet-proof security
- Ask: "If this design was the only thing standing between someone and losing their life savings, would it hold up?" -or- "Could Hal Finney use this?"
- Make your tools accessible and usable, while maintaining security and privacy

## Slogan to Remember

> Solve for one. Extend to many.
