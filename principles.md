# Core Principles

## From Accommodation to Innovation

Accessibility in Bitcoin design isn't about adding features for a small minority - it's about leveraging diverse human experiences to create more robust, usable systems for everyone.

## Security Through Accessibility

In Bitcoin applications, poor usability isn't just inconvenient - it's dangerous. When we design for users at the margins:

- We reduce the likelihood of catastrophic errors
- We make security features more understandable and therefore more effective
- We create resilient systems that work across diverse contexts

## Design Philosophy Shift

| Traditional Approach | Edge-Driven Approach |
|----------------------|---------------------|
| Design for the "average user" | Recognize there is no average user |
| Add accessibility features later | Start with the most constrained use cases |
| Security over usability | Security through usability |
| "Edge cases" as exceptions | "Edge cases" as insights |

## The Cost of Inaccessibility

In Bitcoin applications, inaccessible design has serious consequences:

- **Financial**: Lost funds due to confusion or errors
- **Adoption**: Barriers that prevent widespread use
- **Trust**: Systems that feel risky or confusing
- **Equity**: Tools that only work for technically-savvy users
