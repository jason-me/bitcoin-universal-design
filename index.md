# Designing for the Edges: Bitcoin Accessibility Guide

## Core Heuristic

> "Designing for the extremes in human variation often improves usability for everyone."

This guide explores how building for users with disabilities, impairments, or atypical environments often leads to better Bitcoin experiences for everyone which in turn leads to increased adoption. In Bitcoin applications, where usability is frequently sacrificed for security or privacy, this heuristic helps create more thoughtful, human-centered products.

## Why Accessibility Matters for Bitcoin

- **Mistakes are costly**: Accessible design helps prevent user errors that can lead to irreversible loss of funds
- **Usability inspires confidence**: Trustless systems gain credibility when all users can navigate them independently and successfully regardless of technical skill or ability
- **Complicated UX is a threat vector**: Confusing or inaccessible interfaces increase the risk of mishandled keys, insecure backups, or theft of funds
- **Accessibile design is resilient design**: Tools that work across diverse abilities, devices, and environments are often more robust and reliable in general

## Our Approach

This guide offers practical ways to apply accessibility principles to Bitcoin application design. By focusing on edge cases - people with disabilities, people in resource-constrained environments, or those with limited technical knowledge - we can create better experiences for all users.
