# Designing for the Edges: Bitcoin Accessibility Guide

## Core Heuristic

> "Designing for the extremes in human variation often improves usability for everyone."

This guide explores how building for users with disabilities, impairments, or atypical environments leads to better Bitcoin experiences for everyone. In Bitcoin applications, where usability is frequently sacrificed for security or privacy, this heuristic helps create more thoughtful, human-centered products.

## Why Accessibility Matters for Bitcoin

- **Mistakes are costly**: Accessible design helps prevent user errors that can lead to irreversible loss of funds
- **Confidence through usability**: Trustless systems gain credibility when all users can navigate them independently and successfully
- **Bad UX is a threat vector**: Confusing or inaccessible interfaces increase the risk of mishandled keys, insecure backups, or theft of funds
- **Accessibility = Resilience**: Tools that work across diverse abilities, devices, and environments are more robust and reliable

## Our Approach

This guide offers practical ways to apply accessibility principles to Bitcoin application design. By focusing on edge cases - people with disabilities, people in resource-constrained environments, or those with limited technical knowledge - we create better experiences for all users.
