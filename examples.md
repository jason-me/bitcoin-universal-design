# Practical Examples

Below are specific applications of the "design for the edges" heuristic in Bitcoin applications:

## 1. Recovery Options

**Design for**: Users who struggle with technical complexity or secure storage

**Implementation**:
- Seedless recovery options
- Visual backups or mnemonic alternatives
- Encrypted cloud sync with appropriate security measures

**Universal benefit**: Reduces risk of permanent fund loss for all users while maintaining security

## 2. Transaction Clarity

**Design for**: Users with cognitive disabilities or language barriers

**Implementation**:
- Plain-language transaction summaries (e.g., "Send" vs "Broadcast Raw TX")
- Visual representation of transaction impacts
- Confirmation flows with clear explanations of consequences

**Universal benefit**: Clearer understanding for everyone, fewer mistakes, faster mental processing

## 3. Privacy Options

**Design for**: Users with varying technical comfort levels

**Implementation**:
- Privacy features that are on by default but explained clearly
- Accessible explanations of concepts like address reuse
- Visual indications of privacy status

**Universal benefit**: Better privacy practices with appropriate knowledge for different contexts

## 4. Interface Design

**Design for**: Users with vision or motor impairments

**Implementation**:
- High contrast modes and adjustable text sizes
- Larger tap targets that reduce potential for errors
- Keyboard navigation for power users and those with motor limitations

**Universal benefit**: More accurate interactions, usable in more environments (bright sunlight, on the move)

## 5. Offline & Low-Bandwidth Support

**Design for**: Users in regions with poor connectivity

**Implementation**:
- Progressive web apps that work offline
- Minimal data requirements for core functions
- Alternative communication methods

**Universal benefit**: More resilient applications, faster performance, better battery life
