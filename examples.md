# Practical Examples

Below are specific applications of the "design for the edges" heuristic in Bitcoin applications:

## Recovery Options

**Design for**: Users who struggle with technical complexity, cognitive load, or secure storage management.

**Implementation**:
- **Seedless recovery options** – Enable accessible recovery without requiring manual entry of seed phrases.
- **Visual backups or mnemonic alternatives** – Provide accessible QR codes, visual aids, or other alternative formats that enhance memory recall.
- **Encrypted cloud sync with appropriate security measures** – Allow encrypted backups with client-side encryption and accessible recovery workflows.

**Universal benefit**: Reduces risk of permanent fund loss for all users, particularly those with memory or dexterity challenges.

## Transaction Clarity

**Design for**: Users with cognitive disabilities, language barriers, or information processing difficulties.

**Implementation**:
- **Plain-language transaction summaries** – Use simple, readable language to improve cognitive accessibility and understanding (e.g. "send" vs. "broadcast raw tx").
- **Visual representation of transaction impacts** – Provide accessible diagrams or intuitive visuals to support multiple learning and comprehension styles.
- **Confirmation flows with clear explanations of consequences** – Implement accessible, structured steps that help prevent errors through user feedback.

**Universal benefit**: Clearer understanding for everyone, fewer mistakes, faster cognitive processing.

## Privacy Options

**Design for**: Users with varying levels of technical expertise and digital literacy.

**Implementation**:
- **Privacy features that are on by default but explained clearly and accessibly** – Reduce decision fatigue and improve understanding for non-expert users.
- **Accessible explanations of concepts like address reuse** – Present privacy education in plain language, supporting both screen reader users and visual learners.
- **Visual indications of privacy status** – Use accessible status indicators (color, text labels, icons) that support both visual and non-visual users.

**Universal benefit**: Stronger privacy practices with lower barriers to understanding and safer defaults.

## Interface Design

**Design for**: Users with low vision, color blindness, motor impairments, or limited device control.

**Implementation**:
- **High contrast modes and adjustable text sizes** – Use sufficient contrast ratios and text scaling to support visual accessibility.
- **Larger tap targets that reduce potential for errors** – Ensure target size meets touch accessibility guidelines, aiding users with mobility impairments.
- **Keyboard navigation for power users and those with motor limitations** – Ensure full navigability through logical tab order and visible focus states.

**Universal benefit**: More accurate, inclusive interactions that work for a wider range of abilities and environments.

## Offline & Low-Bandwidth Support

**Design for**: Users in regions with poor connectivity or in situational limitations (e.g., travel, emergencies).

**Implementation**:
- **Progressive web apps that work offline** – Improve accessibility by ensuring some critical functions are available without active network connections.
- **Minimal data requirements for core functions** – Reduce cognitive and technical load by optimizing core workflows and reducing dependency on heavy data processing.
- **Alternative communication methods** – Support offline or device-to-device transactions (QR, NFC, Bluetooth) to maintain functionality under diverse conditions.

**Universal benefit**: More resilient, accessible applications with faster performance and broader usability.
